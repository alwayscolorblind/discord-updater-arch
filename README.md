# Simple discord update script for Arch users (not only)

If you tired of doing `pacman -Syu discord` and it is starting to update whole worlds copmuters, just run this scipt.
Probably you should do this under the `sudo` or just chmod `/opt/discord/resources/build_info.json` to `666`. 

## TODO: 

- Make it smaller, 4mb release wtf
